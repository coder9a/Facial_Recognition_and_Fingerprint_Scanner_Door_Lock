# Facial_Recognition_and_Fingerprint_Scanner_Door_Lock

We will Interface a Fingerprint Sensor Module  with Arduino and will build a Fingerprint based  Biometric Security System in combination with  facial recognition for door locking and  unlocking.
More than 650 criminals, fugitives, persons of
interest or missing persons have been  identified since the launch of INTERPOL’s  facial recognition system at the end of 2016.
One of its main features allows users to open  their front doors (or any door in their home)  using facial recognition, similar to the  authentication system used by many  smartphones today.
The facial recognition market is expected to  grow to $7.7 billion in 2022 from $4 billion in  2017. That’s because facial recognition has all
kinds of commercial applications. It can be  used for everything from surveillance to  marketing.
